## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. There are two primary ways you can contribute: by reporting issues or by submitting code changes through pull requests. To ensure a smooth and effective process for everyone, please follow the guidelines below for the type of contribution you are making.

#### 1. Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

Creating an issue is a highly valuable contribution. If you've found a bug or have an idea for a new feature, this is the place to start.

* Before creating an issue, please check the existing issues to see if your topic is already being discussed.
* If not, create a new issue, choosing the right option: "Bug Report" or "Feature Request". Try to keep the scope minimal but as detailed as possible.

> **A Note on Bug Reports**
> 
> Please complete all the requested fields to the best of your ability. Each piece of information, like the environment versions and a clear description, helps us understand the context of the issue.
> 
> While all details are important, the **[minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)** is the most critical part of your report. It's essential because it removes ambiguity and allows our team to observe the problem firsthand, exactly as you are experiencing it.

#### 2. Contributing Code via Pull Requests

As a first step, please refer to our [Development Conventions](https://github.com/FlowingCode/DevelopmentConventions) page to find information about Conventional Commits & Code Style requirements.

Then, follow these steps for creating a contribution:

- Create an issue to this project about the contribution (bug or feature) if there is no such issue about it already. Try to keep the scope minimal.
- Develop and test the fix or functionality carefully. Only include minimum amount of code needed to fix the issue.
- For commit message, use [Conventional Commits](https://github.com/FlowingCode/DevelopmentConventions/blob/main/conventional-commits.md) to describe your change.

# Developer Guide

## Getting started

Here is a simple example on how to try out the add-on component:

```java
WCStories wcstories = new WCStories(Arrays.asList("/images/story_1.png", "/images/story_2.png"));
wcstories.setHeight(655);
wcstories.setWidth(370);
```
## Special configuration when using Spring

By default, Vaadin Flow only includes ```com/vaadin/flow/component``` to be always scanned for UI components and views. For this reason, the add-on might need to be whitelisted in order to display correctly. 

To do so, just add ```com.flowingcode``` to the ```vaadin.whitelisted-packages``` property in ```src/main/resources/application.properties```, like:

```vaadin.whitelisted-packages = com.vaadin,org.vaadin,dev.hilla,com.flowingcode```
 
More information on Spring whitelisted configuration [here](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/integrations/spring/configuration/#configure-the-scanning-of-packages).
